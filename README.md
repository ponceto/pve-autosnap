# AUTOMATIC SNAPSHOTS FOR PROXMOX VE

## ABSTRACT

`pve-autosnap` is a utility script for the [Proxmox VE](https://www.proxmox.com) hypervisor that allows to perform automatic snapshots with a rotating snapshot feature.

## DESCRIPTION

This script will help you to perform automatic rotated snapshots.

## HOWTO

### Install

If you have `make` on your system:

```bash
make install
```

If you don't have `make` on your system:

```bash
./utils/install.sh
```

### Uninstall

If you have `make` on your system:

```bash
make uninstall
```

If you don't have `make` on your system:

```bash
./utils/uninstall.sh
```

### Build Debian package

If you have `make` on your system you can build a debian package:

```bash
make buildpackage
```

Then you can install the resulting debian package on your target PVE node:

```bash
apt install ./pve-autosnap_X.X.X-X_amd64.deb
```

## USAGE

```
Usage: pve-autosnap [ help | <vmid> [ <keep> [OPTIONS] ] ]

Arguments:

    help                        display this help and exit
    vmid                        specifies the virtual machine id, can be 'all' or 'none'
    keep                        specifies the maximum number of snapshot to keep (default is 1)

    --tag={tag}                 specifies an optional snapshot tag (snapshots will be named "AUTOSNAP_{tag}_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS")

Special options:

    --help                      display this help and exit
    --debug[={yes|no}]          enable/disable the debug mode

    PVE_VM_MANAGER              vm manager (defaults to qm)

```

## EXAMPLES

Perform a snapshot for the vmid #500 and keep one snapshot

```bash
pve-autosnap 500
```

Perform a snapshot for the vmid #750 and keep two snapshots

```bash
pve-autosnap 750 2
```

Perform a snapshot for each vmid and keep one snapshot

```bash
pve-autosnap all
```

Perform a snapshot for each vmid and keep two snapshots

```bash
pve-autosnap all 2
```

Perform a snapshot for each vmid but the #150 and #300 and keep one snapshot

```bash
pve-autosnap all 1 --exclude=150,300
```

Perform a snapshot just for vmid #200 and #250 and keep two snapshots

```bash
pve-autosnap none 2 --include=200,250
```

Perform a snapshot for each vmid between #1000 and #1999 but the #1500 and keep two snapshots

```bash
pve-autosnap all 2 --minvmid=1000 --maxvmid=1999 --exclude=1500
```

Perform a snapshot for each vmid from #1000 and keep three snapshots

```bash
pve-autosnap all 3 --minvmid=1000
```

Perform a snapshot for each vmid to #1999 and keep three snapshots

```bash
pve-autosnap all 3 --maxvmid=1999
```

Perform no snapshot and clean all snapshot for each vmid

```bash
pve-autosnap all 0
```

Perform no snapshot and clean all snapshot for vmid #500

```bash
pve-autosnap 500 0
```

## AUTOMATED SNAPSHOTS

To add a periodic task to perform automated snapshots, just edit your crontab.

It is recommended to redirect `stderr` to `stdout` and pipe the result to the
`logger` utility in order to send the resulting logs to the local syslog service.

Example:

```crontab
# automatic snapshot for vmid #100, every 30m, and keep the last 3 snapshots
*/30 * * * * /usr/local/bin/pve-autosnap 100 3 2>&1 | logger -t autosnap
```

Another example:

```crontab
# automatic snapshot for all vm, at minute 0, every 1h, and keep the last 2 snapshots
0 * * * * /usr/local/bin/pve-autosnap all 2 2>&1 | logger -t autosnap
```

Yet another example:

```crontab
# automatic snapshot for all vm, at minute 5, every 4h, and keep the last 1 snapshot
5 */4 * * * /usr/local/bin/pve-autosnap all 1 2>&1 | logger -t autosnap
```

## TAGGING SNAPSHOTS

Snapshot tagging will allow you to create multiple cron jobs with differents rules, for example hourly, daily, weekly and monthly snapshots:

Example for 48 hourly snapshots:

```crontab
0 * * * * /usr/local/bin/pve-autosnap all 48 --tag=HOURLY 2>&1 | logger -t autosnap-hourly
```

Example for 30 daily snapshots:

```crontab
0 0 * * * /usr/local/bin/pve-autosnap all 30 --tag=DAILY 2>&1 | logger -t autosnap-daily
```

Example for 3 monthly snapshots:

```crontab
0 0 1 * * /usr/local/bin/pve-autosnap all 3 --tag=MONTHLY 2>&1 | logger -t autosnap-monthly
```
